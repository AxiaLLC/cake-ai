**Date earned:** [DATE]

### What this means

You didn't just use AI. You worked with it. You planned projects, broke them
into steps, built things that didn't exist before, debugged problems
systematically, and carried forward what you learned.

Most people never get past the chatbot. You're in the kitchen now.

This certificate is a file on your computer. It's not hosted on someone else's
server. It's not behind a login. It's yours. Just like everything else you
built to earn it.

---

### What's next

The spiral keeps going. Harder projects. More independence. New tools.
You've proven you can do this. The only question now is what you want
to build next.
